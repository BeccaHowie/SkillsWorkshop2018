===============================

Welcome to the GT-IDEaS Summer Skills Workshop 2018! 

Since one of the major goals of this workshop is to introduce best practices in
social coding and software development, we will utilize the `git` version
control software, together with this GitHub repository, to organize and
streamline the submission of all out-of-class assignments.  This way, everyone
gets practice working in a collaborative environment, all while learning about
scientific computing, numerical linear algebra, databases, and machine
learning!

Throughout this workshop, we will utilize a combination of the
[forking](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow)
and [feature-branch](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) workflows,
where each member of the class will work exclusively from their own fork,
instead of directly from the central repository.  This is the standard workflow
for most open-source software projects, and can be used successfully by large
teams of developers simultaneously working on the same projects from around the
world.
