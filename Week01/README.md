Week 01: Introduction to Python
===============================

This week, our focus is to introduce the Python programming language and a few
tools that we'll be using throughout this course.  Our first project will be to
write Python scripts to solve each of the first five problems from [Project
Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), in order to:

* acquaint students with solving problems using Python, 
* learn & practice social coding principles with GitHub.

To get started, [sign up for an account](https://projecteuler.net/register) with 
Project Euler, and try the first two problems.  We will discuss the solutions to
these problems, as well as the potential challenges for the next three problems,
during the first hands-on session on Thursday.

### Assignment Submission

For each Project Euler problem, please create a Python script implementing your
solution with filename `firstinitiallastname_0x.py` (e.g., `jdoe_01.py` for
John Doe's solution to Problem 01), and placed inside each of the `Problem0x`
subdirectories for this week's assignment.  Then, when opening your pull
request, be sure to include your journal entry for the week!
